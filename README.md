This API backend project using Spring boot With Spring Security JWT , Spring Boot 3.3.5 , Java 17

- pom.xml ==> dependencies : Spring Web , Spring Data JPA , MySQL Driver , Spring boot DevTools , spring security , jsonwebtoken
- Packages of the project :
  * Utils ==> contains JWT Utils class used to :
     - generate token based on the information of logged user , set Subject(user name) , set Expiration date of token , set secret Key , set claims(username and password from User details which come from database)
     - setSigningKey() method : convert the encoded secret key(TOKEN_SECRET) into a byte array using Base64 decoding. Then, using Keys.hmacShaKeyFor() , we’ll convert the byte array into the Key
     - isTokenValid() which compare between token and userDetails
     - Also methods like: getUsernameFromToken() , isTokenEpired() , getUserFromToken()
  * Configuration :
      JwtAuthenticationFilter ( each logged user has specific token which must be sent with each request ,this filter check out existence this token and it's validation , if not exist or invalid , the request will be cancled )
      WebSecurityConfiguration (to determine which requests are allowed for only admin, only employees or both or available for any one ) , WebSecurity used to create the FilterChain that performs the web based security for Spring Security and this configuration is imported when using EnableWebSecurity annotation
      Entities ==> entity for each os (Task , comment , User )

  * Dto ==> for each of entity and also for login (loginRequest and loginResponse) and signupDto

  * Repository ==> each entity must has repository for crud operations (TaskRepository , CommentRepository ,taskRepository)

  * Enums ==> UserRole which contains two roles(ADMIN , EMPLOYEE) and TaskStatus for different status of the task (PENDING , INPROGRESS, COMPLETED, DEFERRED, CANCELED) *Services ==> Three Interfaces( AdminService , EmployeeService , AuthService) and three implemented classes ( AdminServiceImpl , EmployeeServiceImpl , AuthServiceImpl)

  * AuthServiceImpl ==> create admin account and signup
  * EmployeeServiceImpl ==> get employee tasks , update task status , get user from token
  * AdminServiceImpl ==> get all users , create task , get all tasks , delete task , get task by id , search task by title,
    update task , createComment , getCommentsByTaskId, mapStringToStatus() which convert incoming string status as TaskStatus is enum
  * Controllers ==> AuthControllers , AdminControllers , EmployeeControllers each controller must has @CrossOrigin("*") to connect later with front end (Angualr)
